But God gave us an entire book of laments in Scripture. He's inviting you to be real.","When you cry out 'How long, O Lord?'—you're in good company. David asked it. Jesus asked it from the cross. Honest lament doesn't push God away; it pulls you closer to Him because you're finally bringing Him your whole heart.","Don't skip over your grief to get to gratitude.

Sometimes you're walking parallel to where you were an hour ago, just at a higher elevation. From where you stand, it feels like you're not making progress. But you are.","Bad days don't erase good progress. A setback isn't the same as starting over. You're not back at the beginning—you're in a new place with more tools, more wisdom, and more of God's strength than you had before.","God isn't surprised by your spiral. He's not disappointed.

It's your soul's alarm system saying, 'This is not okay.'","The problem isn't anger. The problem is when we let anger control us, or when we suppress it so deeply that it turns into bitterness, depression, or shame. Healthy anger says, 'This matters. This boundary matters. This person matters.'","Give yourself permission to feel angry about what was done to you. You don't have to rush to forgiveness. You don't have to spiritualize it away.
