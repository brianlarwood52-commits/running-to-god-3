You're still here.","The valley is dark, but it's not endless. You're walking through, not staying in. And even in the darkest part, God is with you. His rod protects you from danger. His staff guides you forward. You are not abandoned.","You're going to make it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But eventually, you're going to look back and realize you made it through.

Sometimes He speaks in whispers that can only be heard by a heart that has learned to be still.","Elijah expected God in the earthquake, the wind, the fire—in the dramatic and unmistakable. But God came in a whisper. Why? Because whispers require us to draw near, to lean in, to become quiet ourselves.","When God feels silent, it may not be that He's stopped speaking. It may be that He's inviting you into a deeper kind of listening. The kind that happens not in your mind, but in your heart. Not in words, but in His presence.","In the silence, God is often doing His deepest work. Seeds germinate in darkness. Babies grow in the quiet of the womb. And sometimes, your greatest spiritual growth happens in the seasons when you can't hear Him clearly but choose to trust Him anyway."],"reflection":"Have you been listening for God in the earthquake when He's actually speaking in the whisper? What might He be saying in the silence?","prayer":"Father, when I cannot hear Your voice, help me trust Your heart. Teach me to be still enough to hear Your whisper.

You don't have to let last week's mistakes define this week's possibilities. God's mercy is not rationed or limited. It's fresh every single morning.","Beginning again doesn't mean you've failed. It means you're human. It means you're brave enough to try once more. It means you haven't given up, and neither has God.","Today is a blank page. What you wrote yesterday is done. The pen is in your hand again, and God is whispering, 'Let's try this together.' Take a deep breath. This is a new day."],"reflection":"What area of your life needs a fresh start?
