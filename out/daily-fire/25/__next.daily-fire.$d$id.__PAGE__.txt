You are more than what you're struggling with. You are a child of God.","A diagnosis can be helpful. It gives language to what you're experiencing, opens doors to treatment, connects you with others who understand. But it's not your name. Your name is Beloved, Chosen, Redeemed, Called.","Mental illness is not a moral failing. It's not a spiritual deficiency. It's a health condition that affects your brain the way diabetes affects your pancreas. You wouldn't be ashamed of diabetes. Don't be ashamed of depression.","Getting help is brave. Taking medication is not weak faith. Going to therapy is not admitting defeat. You take care of your body because it's the temple God gave you. That includes your brain."],"reflection":"Have you been letting a diagnosis define you? What is your true identity in Christ?","prayer":"Father, thank You that my identity is found in You, not in my struggles.

You can be chosen by God and still wrestle with darkness. These things are not contradictions—they're the human experience.","God doesn't need you to be okay to use you. He doesn't need you to have it all together. He specializes in working through broken vessels. Your struggle doesn't diminish your worth or your calling.","Keep showing up, even on the days when everything in you wants to give up. Keep reaching out, even when it feels pointless.
