<p>Sometimes God meets us in the most unexpected places. For me, it was on a hillside under some trees, sitting on a rock that would become the birthplace of this ministry.</p>

<h2>The Pain That Led Me There</h2>

<p>The family reunion had started with such hope. After years of being separated from my cousins, we were finally together again. But what should have been a celebration of family became a nightmare of manipulation and disrespect. One cousin, trapped in her own narcissistic patterns, turned what should have been healing into fresh wounds.</p>

<p>The way she treated my mother was the final straw. In trying to protect the family peace, I found myself losing connection with cousins I had just rediscovered. The pain was overwhelming—not just the immediate hurt, but the deeper ache of family brokenness that seemed to follow me everywhere.</p>

<h2>The Climb to Prayer Rock</h2>

<p>In my anguish, I did what I've always done when the world becomes too much: I went to the hills. There's something about elevation that puts things in perspective, something about being closer to the sky that makes prayer feel more possible.</p>

<p>I found myself on a familiar trail, but this time I was drawn to a spot I'd never really noticed before. Under a canopy of trees, there was a large rock—nothing spectacular, just a solid place to sit and think. But as I settled onto that stone, something shifted.</p>

<h2>The Prayer That Birthed a Ministry</h2>

<p>Sitting on that rock, I poured out my heart to God. I told Him about the family pain, the repeated patterns of hurt, the way shame seemed to follow me from relationship to relationship. I asked Him why healing felt so elusive, why family could be both the source of our deepest wounds and our greatest longing.</p>

<p>But then something beautiful happened. As I sat there in my pain, I began to sense God's presence in a way I hadn't experienced before. It wasn't that my circumstances changed—the family situation was still broken. But I felt God saying, "Your pain has a purpose, Brian. Your wounds can become doorways for others to find healing."</p>

<h2>From Personal Pain to Ministry Vision</h2>

<p>That day on the rock, Shame to Flame was born. Not as a grand plan or a strategic ministry vision, but as a simple understanding: God doesn't waste our pain. Every tear we cry, every wound we carry, every moment of despair can become a bridge to help someone else find their way to healing.</p>

<p>I realized that my family struggles, my battles with shame, my journey through spiritual wounds—none of it was meaningless. God wanted to use all of it to create something beautiful: a place where others could find the hope I was discovering on that rock.</p>

<h2>The Rock Remains</h2>

<p>I still go back to that rock sometimes. It's become my Prayer Rock—a place where I remember that God meets us in our mess, that He transforms our shame into flame, and that our stories of brokenness can become testimonies of His incredible grace.</p>

<p>Every time I write a reflection, every time I share a teaching, every time I pray for someone who reaches out to this ministry, I remember that rock. I remember that God can take our deepest pain and turn it into our greatest purpose.</p>

<h2>Your Rock Awaits</h2>

<p>Maybe you have a rock too—a place where God met you in your pain and began to transform it into purpose. Or maybe you're still looking for that place, still waiting for God to make sense of your suffering.</p>

<p>If that's you, I want you to know: your rock is waiting. God has a place where He wants to meet you, where your pain will begin to make sense, where your shame will start its transformation into flame.</p>

<p>The question isn't whether God can use your pain—He can and He will. The question is whether you're ready to let Him.</p>

<p><em>What's your Prayer Rock story? I'd love to hear how God has met you in unexpected places and turned your pain into purpose.</em></p>
