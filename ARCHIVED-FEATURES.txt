                         NOTES FOR FUTURE RESTORATION
================================================================================

GENERAL GUIDANCE:
- All archived code uses the same design system (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Icon dependencies are from lucide-react package (already installed)
- Color scheme follows site standards: flame, sky, sage palettes
- All sections are fully responsive (mobile-first design)

TESTING CHECKLIST WHEN RESTORING:
[ ] Update placeholder content with real data
[ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop
[ ] Verify all links and buttons work
[ ] Check dark mode appearance
[ ] Ensure icons render correctly
[ ] Validate accessibility (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
[ ] Update any stale references or deprecated code

PRIORITY ORDER FOR RESTORATION:
1. Contact Page Cards - When phone line established
2. How We Work Together - When first partners join
3. Join Network Section - When ready to recruit partners
4. Impact Statistics - When metrics tracking implemented


================================================================================
                            ADDITIONAL NOTES
================================================================================

All archived sections maintain the ministry's visual identity:
- Serif fonts (Crimson Text) for headings
- Sans-serif (Inter) for body text
- Warm color palette focused on flame orange and sky blue
- Trauma-informed, compassionate tone
- Scripture-based, Christ-centered messaging

The archived code is production-ready and simply needs:
1. Real content to replace placeholders
2. Working backend systems/services
3. Integration testing after restoration

specific .md files in the archived-sections/ directory.
